This release introduces 6 new components,\nour new CLI, and several enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n## What's New in v2.3.0?\n\n- [NextUI CLI](/docs/guide/cli) - A command-line interface for creating and managing NextUI projects.\n- [DateInput](/docs/components/date-input) - Allows users to enter and edit date and time values using a keyboard.\n- [TimeInput](/docs/components/time-input) - Allows users to enter and edit time values using a keyboard.\n- [Calendar](/docs/components/calendar) - Displays a calendar for selecting dates and times.\n- [RangeCalendar](/docs/components/range-calendar) - Displays a calendar for selecting date ranges.\n- [DatePicker](/docs/components/date-picker) - Allows users to select a date from a calendar.\n- [DateRangePicker](/docs/components/date-range-picker) - Allows users to select a date range from a calendar.\n- [Other Changes](#other-changes) - Includes styling improvements, accessibility and usability enhancements.\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\nRequirements:\n\n- [Tailwind CSS 3.4](https://tailwindcss.com/) or later\n\nUpgrade today by running one of the following commands:\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\n<PackageManagers\n  commands={{\n    cli: \"nextui upgrade\",\n    npm: \"npx nextui-cli@latest upgrade\",\n  }}\n/>\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\n## NextUI CLI\n\nWe are thrilled to introduce the [NextUI CLI](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui-cli), a command-line interface, It offers a comprehensive suite\nof commands to initialize, manage, and improve your NextUI projects. It enables you to `add`, `remove`, or\n`upgrade` individual components, assess the health of your project, and more.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install the CLI globally, execute one of the following commands in your terminal:\n\n<PackageManagers\n  commands={{\n    npm: \"npm install nextui-cli -g\",\n    yarn: \"yarn add nextui-cli -g\",\n    pnpm: \"pnpm add nextui-cli -g\",\n    bun: \"bun add nextui-cli -g\",\n  }}\n/>\n\nAlternatively, you can use the CLI without a global installation by employing `npx`:\n\n```bash\nnpx nextui-cli@latest\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce the CLI is installed, run the following command to display available commands:\n\n```bash\nnextui\n```\n\nNextUI CLI can help you create new projects, add components, upgrade components, remove components, detect issues in\nyou setup, know your environment, and more.\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\nTo initialize a new project, you can simply run:\n\n```bash\nnextui init my-nextui-app\n```\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\nYou will be prompted to configure your project:\n\n```codeBlock bash\n? Select a template › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.\n❯   App\n    A Next.js 13 with app directory template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.\n    Pages\n    A Next.js 13 with pages directory template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.\n```\n\nSelect the template you want to use and the CLI will create a new project for you.\n\n> We're working on adding more templates to the CLI, so stay tuned for updates!\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\nIf you already have a NextUI project, you can add components to it using the `add` command:\n\n```bash\nnextui add date-input\n```\n\nIt will automatically detect the required dependencies, modify your `tailwind.config.(js|ts)` file,\ndetect whether using `pnpm` if so, add the required configuration to your `.npmrc` file and add the component to your project.\n\nIf instead of installing a single component you want to install multiple components, you can do so by separating them with a space:\n\n```bash\nnextui add date-input time-input calendar\n```\n\nYou can alternatively install the `main` package which includes all the components by passing the `--all` flag:\n\n```bash\nnextui add --all\n```\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\n> The CLI is currentl in `Alpha` stage, we're working on adding more features and improvements. If you find any issues or have any suggestions, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui-cli/issues/new).\n\nTo learn more about the CLI and its commands, please refer to the [CLI documentation](/docs/guide/cli) and the [CLI API reference](/docs/api-references/cli-api).\n\n## New Components\n\nSince the beginning of NextUI, devs have been asking for date and time input components. After\nmonths of iteration and development, we are excited to introduce the following new components:\n\n### DateInput\n\nDateInput is a component that allows users to enter and edit date and time values using a keyboard.\nEach part of a date value is displayed in an individually editable segment.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Usage\" files={dateInputContent.usage} />\n\nGo to the [DateInput documentation](/docs/components/date-input) to learn more about the component.\n\n### TimeInput\n\nThe `TimeInput` component consists of a label, and a group of segments representing each unit of a time (e.g. hours, minutes, and seconds). Each segment is individually focusable and editable by the user, by typing or using the arrow keys to increment and decrement the value. This approach allows values to be formatted and parsed correctly regardless of the locale or time format, and offers an easy and error-free way to edit times using the keyboard.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Usage\" files={timeInputContent.usage} />\n\nGo to the [TimeInput documentation](/docs/components/time-input) to learn more about the component.\n\n### Calendar\n\nA Calendar consists of a grouping element containing one or more date grids (e.g. months), and a previous and next button for navigating between date ranges. Each calendar grid consists of cells containing button elements that can be pressed and navigated to using the arrow keys to select a date.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Usage\" files={calendarContent.usage} />\n\nThe calendar also supports selecting years and months for rapid selection.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"With Month And Year Picker\" files={calendarContent.withMonthAndYearPicker} />\n\nGo to the [Calendar documentation](/docs/components/calendar) to learn more about the component.\n\n### RangeCalendar\n\nA Range calendar consists of a grouping element containing one or more date grids (e.g. months), and a previous and next button for navigating through time. Each calendar grid consists of cells containing button elements that can be pressed and navigated to using the arrow keys to select a date range. Once a start date is selected, the user can navigate to another date using the keyboard or by hovering over it, and clicking it or pressing the Enter key commits the selected date range.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Usage\" files={rangeCalendarContent.usage} />\n\nGo to the [RangeCalendar documentation](/docs/components/range-calendar) to learn more about the component.\n\n### DatePicker\n\nA Date Picker combines a DateInput and a Calendar popover to allow users to enter or select a date and time value.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Usage\" files={datePickerContent.usage} />\n\nGo to the [DatePicker documentation](/docs/components/date-picker) to learn more about the component.\n\n### DateRangePicker\n\nDate Range Picker combines two DateInputs and a RangeCalendar popover to allow users to enter or select a date and time range.\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Usage\" files={dateRangePickerContent.usage} />\n\nGo to the [DateRangePicker documentation](/docs/components/date-range-picker) to learn more about the component.\n\n\n### Calendar Presets\n\n`Calendar` and `RangeCalendar` components support adding custom content at the top and bottom of the calendar, this is useful for adding presets or \ncustom actions to the calendar.\n\nHere's an example of how to add presets to the `Calendar` component:\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"Calendar Presets\" files={calendarContent.presets} />\n\n### Internationalization\n\nThese new components have built-in internationalization, time zones and granularity support, they supports selecting dates\nin many calendar systems used around the world, including `Gregorian`, `Hebrew`, `Indian`, `Islamic`, `Buddhist`, and more.\n\nDates are automatically displayed in the appropriate calendar system for the user's locale this is possible thanks to [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/) package, which\nincludes functions for parsing strings in multiple formats into `ZonedDateTime` objects.\n\nHere's and example using the `Indian` calendar system:\n\n<CodeDemo title=\"International Calendar\" files={datePickerContent.internationalCalendar} />\n\nAlternatively you can set the `locale` globally by using the `NextUIProvider` component:\n\n```jsx\n// Next.js App Router example\n\"use client\";\n\nimport {NextUIProvider} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\n\nexport interface ProvidersProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport function Providers({children}: ProvidersProps) {\n  const router = useRouter();\n\n  return <NextUIProvider locale=\"hi-IN-u-ca-indian\">{children}</NextUIProvider>;\n}\n```\n\nIf no `locale` is provided, it will extract the locale from the browser.\n\n### NextUI Provider\n\nThe `NextUIProvider` component was updated to include the `createCalendar` function, which allows you to create a calendar instance with the specified locale and time zone,\nand the `defaultDates` object which allows you to set global minimum and maximum dates for the components.\n\n```jsx\n// Next.js App Router example\n\"use client\";\n\nimport {NextUIProvider, SupportedCalendars} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\nimport {CalendarDate, GregorianCalendar} from \"@internationalized/date\";\n\nexport interface ProvidersProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}\n\nfunction createCalendar(identifier: SupportedCalendars) {\n  switch (identifier) {\n    case \"gregory\":\n      return new GregorianCalendar();\n    default:\n      throw new Error(`Unsupported calendar ${identifier}`);\n  }\n}\n\nexport function Providers({children}: ProvidersProps) {\n  const router = useRouter();\n\n  return (\n    <NextUIProvider\n      locale=\"hi-IN-u-ca-indian\"\n      defaultDates={{\n        minDate: new CalendarDate(1900, 1, 1),\n        maxDate: new CalendarDate(2099, 12, 31),\n      }}\n      createCalendar={createCalendar}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </NextUIProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### Removal of the `units` creation\n\nTo improve performance and reduce bundle size, we have removed the `units` creation from the \n`nextui` plugin. [TailwindCSS v3.4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-4) added support for `min-h-*` and `min-w-*` classes, so it is no longer needed.\n\nHow to upgrade:\n\n1. Upgrade TailwindCSS to version 3.4 or later (if you haven't already). You can do this by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install tailwindcss@latest\n```\n\n2. Remove the `spacingUnit` configuration from your `tailwind.config.(js|ts)` file (if you have it):\n\n```diff-js\n plugins: [\n    nextui({\n      layout: {\n-       spacingUnit: 4,\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n```\n\n3. Find all `-unit` classes in your project and replace them with a `-` separator. For example, replace `p-unit-4` with `p-4`.\n\n```diff-jsx\nimport {Button} from \"@nextui-org/react\";\n\nexport const MyButton = () => {\n  return (\n-    <Button className=\"px-unit-2 py-unit-1 min-w-unit-48\">\n+    <Button className=\"px-2 py-1 min-w-48\">\n      My Button\n    </Button>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Separation for `errorMessage` and `isInvalid`\n\nWe are currently working on supporting multiple types of validation, including native HTML constraint validation, custom validation, and real-time validation. \nDue to this reason, the requirements for displaying error messages have become more varied, and it is necessary to handle validation conditions separately from the `errorMessage`.\n\nHow to upgrade:\n\n1. To display `errorMessage`, `isInvalid` must be set to `true`.\n\n```diff-jsx\n<Input\n  type=\"email\"\n  label=\"Email\"\n  variant=\"bordered\"\n  defaultValue=\"junior2nextui.org\"\n+ isInvalid={true}\n  errorMessage=\"Please enter a valid email\"\n  className=\"max-w-xs\"\n/>\n```\n\nThat's it! Your project should now be using the latest version of TailwindCSS and NextUI.\n\n<Spacer y={4} />\n\n\n## Other Changes\n\n**Bug Fixes**:\n\n- Fixed an HSL color rounding issue in the theme settings to ensure accurate color representation.
