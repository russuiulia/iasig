        <p>
          The cost of travel insurance for a single trip is determined on a per-day basis and varies
          depending on the insurance company, travel destination, insured amount, insured person age
          and additional risks. In contrast, multi-trip insurance, or multivisa, has a fixed price
          for a predetermined period. The prices for both single and multi-trip insurance are listed
          in EUR, and the user pays in MDL at the BNM rate.
